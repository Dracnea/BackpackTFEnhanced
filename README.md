# Backpack TF Enhanced
Extension to add features and visibility to backpack.tf

You can add this Extension by enabling developer mode for your Chromium (Chrome, Brave, etc) based browser and then add it as the entire download.

As of 7/1/2024 backpack.tf has announced next.backpack.tf which will eventually replace backpack.tf's UI entirely. This updated UI addresses every suggestion I have brought up to their staff and TF2 community members over the last 4+ years. They have added equal or superior versions of my extension UI and additional features that would have only been possible from backend.

Therefore, this project is defunct as it is no longer a good use of my time despite being an excellent refresher of javascript, json, web browser programming, and learning how to create chrome web extensions.

I will look into leveraging next.backpack.tf API to create a lightweight application and / or a postman library that allows ordinary people to make requests to their service. This way users can choose to have results saved as files, such as .xls (MS excel) or .csv (Comma Seperated Lists).
