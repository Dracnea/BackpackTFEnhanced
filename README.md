# Backpack TF Enhanced
Extension to add features and visibility to backpack.tf

You can add this Extension by enabling developer mode for your Chromium (Chrome, Brave, etc) based browser and then add it as the entire download.

As of 7/1/2024 backpack.tf has announced next.backpack.tf which will eventually replace backpack.tf's UI entirely. This new updated UI of theirs addresses every suggestion I have brought up to them and other community members over the last 4+ years. Their new UI update has every aspect that I have at some point either created or suggested and then some. 

Therefore, this project is defunct as it is no longer a good use of my time despite being an excellent refresher of javascript, json, web browser programming, and learning how to create chrome web extensions.

I will look into leveraging next.backpack.tf API to create a lightweight application and postman library that allows ordinary people to make requests to their service and get responses back. This way users can choose to have results saved as files, such as .xls (MS excel) or .csv (Comma Seperated Lists).
